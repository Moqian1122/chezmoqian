Neural networks could perform very well for certain problems. However, companies are hesitative to select neural networks as the modelling solution for their business questions due to its little interpretability because business runners are cautious and they require to know everything. Hence, if this type of 'black-box' model could be interpreted, it would help to boost business better since it would be more widely accepted. People pursue interpreting model fully. However, even a model is not fully interpretable, we could still try to say something about it.
